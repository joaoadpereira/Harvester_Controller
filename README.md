# Harvester_Controller

This is a C# script to control a Harvester machine in a virtual forest with Oculus Rift Controller in real-time. 

The script is part of an Unity project in Virtual Reality. It uses AGX Dynamics multi-physics for CAD real-time simulation.
The machine was designed with the CAD tool SolidWorks and the simulation environment provided by AGX Momentum and AGX Unity.

For more information about the project, whatch my [TechBites pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWQxcPC1b10) at Tampere University.
